BSK Notus Modbus Integration

This repository contains my research, findings, and implementation for integrating and controlling a BSK Notus unit using the Modbus protocol.

The goal of this project is to document how the BSK Notus communicates over Modbus and to provide a practical reference for reading data and sending control commands programmatically.
